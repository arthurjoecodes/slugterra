<h3><strong>The team</strong></h3>
<p>
The Shane Gang is a Slugslinging gang founded by Eli Shane, when he decides to team up with his friends to help defeat the evil in SlugTerra. The Shane Gang is dedicated to stopping crime throughout SlugTerra.
Like the common slinger, the gang uses standard slinging gear, although with a few blaster upgrades and heavily modded mechas. Unlike other slingers, the gang has a large amount of slugs combined into one entire group, from which each member contributes and draws from, for example, Digger has been seen used by multiple members.
The Shane Gang normally travel via Mecha Beasts and occasionally they will ride other vehicles provided for them. Each member (not including Twist), posses their own personal Mecha-Beast. The Mecha-Beasts are upgraded by Kord and now have the ability to transform into motorcycles and go-karts.

<h3><em><strong>Eli</strong></em></h3>
<p>
<em>
Eli rarely thinks about money and seems to have no interest on being rich, as opposed to Pronto. He seems to value his friendships with his friends and Slugs more than money could ever give him. This is shown multiple times throughout the show as well as being directly stated by Kord and Eli that he doesn't really care much for money, no matter how much was offered to him. He is one of the only people to name their Slugs as he gets them, giving them each a unique nickname. Eli is shown to treat them more as a family instead of his ammo as normal people do. His bond with his Slugs makes him refuse to trade them in order to keep them close. As stated frequently throughout the show/slugisodes, almost all Slugs generally like Eli.
He is also highly responsible and mature as he is able to care for himself at a young age without much guidance, but he still remains a reckless and adventurous teenager at heart.

<h3><em><strong>Trixie</strong></em></h3>
<p>
<em>
Trixie is generally a kind and thoughtful individual. Although she likes to keep an eye out for unusual Slugs, she always has her head in the game and can often spot an exit or a come up with a new tactic when the team is caught up in the fight.
She has a strong sense of justice, as Trixie says that she would try to keep the peace. This was largely in part due to the disappearance of Will Shane, after which slingers came and terrorized her home cavern. Trixie decided to spread the news of what was happening in Slugterra, both good and bad, and she faithfully helps Eli gain acknowledgment as the new Shane. She makes Slugisodes using her trusty camera to teach people about Slugs and how to care for them, as well as how to duel. Her dream is to make a documentary film about Slugs and their little society they have together.
Trixie is extremely loyal to the Shane Gang and will help all of them while needed, especially the leader, Eli Shane.

<h3><em><strong>Kord</strong></em></h3>
<p>
<em>
Kord is a fun-loving, kind hearted cave troll. Despite looking fearsome and dangerous, he has a really big heart. As a big-hearted troll, he also loves to play practical jokes and is extremely easy going. He likes to crack up jokes as well as acting whenever he tries to explain something that has to do with machines and Mechas.
As a cave troll, Kord naturally likes building machines as well as upgrading equipment, most of which are the Shane Gang's equipment. He likes to boast about his abilities as an engineer and builder, and dislikes to admit defeat if he cannot fix something. He loves making machines so much, he had stayed locked in the Shane Gang's garage as he upgraded their Mechas. Even though he loves making and building machines, he still states that he'd like to be a Slugslinger as opposed to being a full-time engineer like his other family members.

<h3><em><strong>Pronto</strong></em></h3>
<p>
<em>
Pronto is an extremely egotistic molenoid who cares about nothing more than fame, fortune, and a life of comfort. Despite these self-centered traits, Pronto is shown to be very caring towards everyone on his team. He is funny and comedic as well as self-centered, and is always around to cheer up the Shane Gang or make things worse. His egotistic and unique personality allows him to be the comic relief when things get rough.
The molenoid has an obsession with fame and fortune, seizing any opportunity to become rich and famous. He doesn't care about the well-being of Slugs too much, unless it earns him the title of a "righteous and humble" hero. Pronto has a tendency to make up tall-tales about his adventures. Although he is obsessed with being rich, Pronto is shown multiple times to be spending a sum amount of money to get things for comfort, even to the point where he spends the Shane Gang's money.

<h3><em><strong>Will</strong></em></h3>
<p>
<em>
Not much known is known about Will's early life, but he lived part-time in Slugterra and part-time in the Surface. When he was about 15 years old, he was confronted by the Unbeatable Master and when he had proven himself to her, he spent about 10 years learning from her to become a master slugslinger. He eventually settled down and got married to have a son named Eli. He raised Eli as well as protecting Slugterra at the same time. At one point, he promised Eli that he would take him down to Slugterra and they would start their adventure together.
Disappearance
When Eli was ten years old, he was dueling Dr. Blakk, his lifelong rival who had gone the wrong side of the path. Blakk then uses a Tempesto Ghoul Slug which short-circuits and starts to suck in Will. He then tells Burpy to go tell his son Eli about his demise and to give him a letter. He is unfortunately unable to make his promise with his son to go to Slugterra together.

<h3><em><strong>Jimmo</strong></em></h3>
<p>
<em>
During his time in SlugTerra, Jimmo kept a notebook written in the Shane code. This book contained extensive notes on SlugTerra, including how to travel back up to the Surface. Somehow, Gar Revelle ended up with Jimmo's notebook, although he lacked the cipher needed to translate the code.
At a certain point, Jimmo left his role as the Shane, giving his nephew Will his blaster and role.
He might be mentioned by Eli in Slugterra: Into the Shadows as the uncle who took care of Eli since his mother left him at the age of 10. Though, this is not confirmed, but it is likely after his retirement he must have lived in The Surface and taking care of Eli.
Return
Will returns as the Goon's new host in Return of the Elementals, but is freed by Eli. However, he sacrifices himself for Eli and the Elementals by pushing himself, Dr. Blakk and the The Goon into a portal that leads to the Deep Caverns.
